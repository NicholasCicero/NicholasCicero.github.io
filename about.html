    <div class="band-info">
        <p>Stage Fright is a band from northeast Ohio. 4 members. A drummer, bassist, lead guitarist, and lead vocalist. All go under anonymous names so their identities are hidden from the world. Songs go from being lighter at the beginning to progressively more heavy throughout the album, to symbolize pressure and paranoia. The last song in the album will symbolize them being “frightened” (connecting them to stage fright) Most of the albums will keep on this path. Three, eight track albums will be shown, each telling their own story. One of the albums will be up and coming for the band. The first one has already been released in 2021 and the second one in 2023, the next album will be released in June of 2025. No songs from the album have been released as a pre-release.

    <div class="backstory">
        <p>These four people had met back in middle school, becoming the best of friends. One of the people in the band had gotten a guitar for christmas, the rest of them followed suit. Using Salem's garage as a studio, they soon gained attention on TikTok and in their neighborhood for their odd but appealing style of writing. After years of practice and gaining followers, these four individuals wanted to make something of themselves. To be better than any other artist in the world. Together, they used their musical prowess and anonymity to create Stage Fright. A band that shows the struggle of not being seen by others. A band that resonates with the loners of the world. A band that creates a space like no other.
